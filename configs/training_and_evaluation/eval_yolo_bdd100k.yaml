  imgsz: 640      # Input image size for training_and_evaluation (YOLO will resize all images to this width/height)
  batch: 16       # Number of images per batch. Larger batch â†’ more stable training_and_evaluation but requires more VRAM

  conf: 0.25      # Confidence threshold for predictions; detections above this value are considered valid
  iou: 0.6        # Intersection over Union threshold used for NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) to remove overlapping detections
